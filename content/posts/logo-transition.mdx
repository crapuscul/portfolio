# How to Add a Second Logo in Dawn Theme Header with Smooth Transitions

Adding smooth transitions to the header's background color and logo changes can significantly enhance the visual appeal of your Shopify Dawn theme. In this post, we will go step-by-step through the process of implementing these transitions using JavaScript and CSS.

## Introduction

This guide demonstrates how to dynamically change the header's background color and switch between two logos as the user scrolls down the page. When the page is scrolled more than 50 pixels, the background color of the header changes, and the primary logo fades out to be replaced by a secondary logo. This is done using JavaScript for event handling and CSS for smooth transitions.

## Event Listener for Scroll

We use the `scroll` event to monitor when the user scrolls the page:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('scroll', function() {
  const headerWrapper = document.querySelector('.header-wrapper');
  const logoPrimary = document.querySelector('.header__heading-logo');
  const logoSecondary = document.querySelector('.header__heading-logo-second');

  // Check if the page is scrolled more than 50px
  if (window.scrollY > 50) {
    // Change header background color
    headerWrapper.classList.add('color-on-scroll');
    // Fade out the first logo and fade in the second one
    logoPrimary.style.opacity = '0';  // Fade out primary logo
    setTimeout(function() {
      logoPrimary.style.display = 'none';  // Set display none after fading out
      logoSecondary.style.display = 'block';  // Display the secondary logo
      setTimeout(function() {
        logoSecondary.style.opacity = '1';  // Fade in secondary logo after display change
      }, 10);  // Small timeout to ensure opacity transition kicks in
    }, 0);  // Delay to match CSS transition timing
  } else {
    // Change header background color back
    headerWrapper.classList.remove('color-on-scroll');

    // Fade out the second logo and fade in the first one
    logoSecondary.style.opacity = '0';  // Fade out secondary logo
    setTimeout(function() {
      logoSecondary.style.display = 'none';  // Set display none after fading out
      logoPrimary.style.display = 'block';  // Display the primary logo
      setTimeout(function() {
        logoPrimary.style.opacity = '1';  // Fade in primary logo after display change
      }, 10);  // Small timeout to ensure opacity transition kicks in
    },0);  // Delay to match CSS transition timing
  }
});
```

### Key Points:
- The `scroll` event triggers at more than 50px of vertical scroll.
- The logos are transitioned using the `opacity` and `display` properties for smooth fading.

## Background Color Change

We use a class to change the background color when the page is scrolled beyond 50px. The transition is smoothened by using CSS:

```css
/* Transition for smooth background color change on scroll */
.header-wrapper {
  background-color: transparent; /* Default background color */
  transition: background-color 0.15s ease-in-out; /* Smooth background color transition */
}
/* When scrolled, change background color */
.header-wrapper.color-on-scroll {
  background-color: rgb(var(--color-background)) !important;
}
```

### Key Points:
- The default background color is transparent.
- When scrolled, a new background color is applied, making the header more visually engaging.

## Logo Transition Logic

When scrolling down past 50px:
- **Fade Out Primary Logo**: The primary logo fades out by reducing its opacity.
- **Show Secondary Logo**: The secondary logo is displayed with an opacity transition to fade in smoothly.

When scrolling up (less than 50px):
- **Fade Out Secondary Logo**: The secondary logo fades out and the primary logo fades back in.


## CSS for Smooth Transitions

We use **CSS transitions** to create a smooth fade effect for both the background color and the logos:

```css
/* Common transition for both logos (primary and secondary) to fade in and out */
.header__heading-logo, .header__heading-logo-second {
  transition: opacity 0.15s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for fading in/out */
  opacity: 1; /* Default opacity (fully visible) */
}

/* Secondary logo is hidden by default */
.header__heading-logo-second {
  display: none; /* Hidden by default */
}
```

## Why This Solution is Beneficial

This approach enhances the **user experience** in several ways:
1. **Improved Branding**: By switching between logos, you can emphasize different branding aspects depending on the scroll position (e.g., showing a simpler logo for a sticky header).
2. **Visual Appeal**: Smooth transitions make your site feel more polished and professional.
3. **Responsive Design**: The solution is optimized for quick transitions, ensuring users on different devices experience seamless logo switches.
