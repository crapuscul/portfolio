Creating a countdown timer isn't just about showing time ticking down‚Äîit's about driving action. When your Shopify store visitors see time slipping away, they‚Äôre more likely to make a purchase. This is urgency at its finest.

- **Creates Urgency:** The ticking clock tells visitors: ‚ÄúAct now, or miss out.‚Äù
- **Increases Conversions:** A countdown timer triggers impulse purchases, reducing hesitation.
- **Perfect for Promotions:** Whether it's a flash sale or seasonal offer, timers make offers feel special.

<HeadingWithId id="step-1-set-up-your-html-structure" as="h3">Step 1: Set Up Your HTML Structure</HeadingWithId>

First, we need to create a place where our countdown timer will live. Add this to your announcement bar Liquid file (or wherever you want it to show up on your Shopify store).

1. Go to your Shopify admin, then navigate to **Online Store > Themes**.
2. **Duplicate your theme** before making any changes to ensure you have a backup.
3. Click on the **3 dots** next to your theme and select **Edit code**.
4. In the search bar, search for `announcement-bar.liquid`.
5. Once you're in the file, press `Ctrl + F` and search for the `announcement-bar__message` class to locate it.
6. Replace that section with the following HTML code:

```html
     
  <div id="countdown-timer" style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size:30px; color:#f12052">HURRY UP!</span><br>
    <span>FALL SALE - <span style="color:#5ef98d">Ends in:</span> </span><br>
    <span id="countdown" style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
  </div>
```


<HeadingWithId id="step-2-set-up-custom-css-and-javascript-files" as="h3">Step 2: Set Up Custom CSS and JavaScript Files</HeadingWithId>

To keep things organized, we‚Äôll create separate custom files for the countdown timer's CSS and JavaScript. Follow these steps:

1. **Create Custom CSS File:**
   - In your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store > Themes**.
   - Click the **3 dots** and select **Edit code**.
   - Under the "Assets" folder, click on **Add a new asset**.
   - Create a new file named `countdown-timer.css`.

   Add the following CSS code:

   ```css
      #countdown-timer {
     padding: 0;
     min-width: 50%;
     color: #fff;
     text-align: center;
     font-size: 14px;
     border-radius: 10px;
   }
   #countdown {
     display:flex;
     justify-content:center;
     gap:10px;
     font-weight: bold;
     font-size: 18px;
     
   }
    .label{
    font-size:12px  
        }
   ```

2. **Create Custom JavaScript File:**
   - Under the "Assets" folder, click on **Add a new asset**.
   - Create a new file named `countdown-timer.js`.

   Add the following JavaScript code:

   ```javascript
   // Set the end date and time for the countdown
   const saleEndDate = new Date("December 31, 2024 23:59:59").getTime();

   // Function to update the countdown every second
   function updateCountdown() {
     const now = new Date().getTime();
     const timeRemaining = saleEndDate - now;

     if (timeRemaining < 0) {
       document.getElementById("countdown-timer").innerHTML = "SALE ENDED!";
       clearInterval(countdownInterval);
       return;
     }

     const days = Math.floor(timeRemaining / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
     const hours = Math.floor((timeRemaining % (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) / (1000 * 60 * 60));
     const minutes = Math.floor((timeRemaining % (1000 * 60 * 60)) / (1000 * 60));
     const seconds = Math.floor((timeRemaining % (1000 * 60)) / 1000);

    document.getElementById("countdown").innerHTML = `
      <div class="countdown-item">${days}<div class="label">Days</div></div>
      <div class="countdown-item">${hours}<div class="label">Hrs</div></div>
      <div class="countdown-item">${minutes}<div class="label">Mins</div></div>
      <div class="countdown-item">${seconds}<div class="label">Secs</div></div>
    `;
    }

    // Update the countdown every second
    const countdownInterval = setInterval(updateCountdown, 1000);
    updateCountdown();
   ```

3. **Include the CSS and JavaScript Files in Your Liquid File:**
   - Still in the code editor, search for `announcement-bar.liquid`.
   - Include links to your custom CSS and JS files by adding the following lines at the top of the liquid file:

   ```liquid
   {{ 'countdown-timer.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}
   <script src="{{ 'countdown-timer.js' | asset_url }}" defer="defer"></script>
   ```

By doing this, your countdown timer will be fully functional, and you‚Äôve kept your code organized and easy to maintain.
